Intro
In this project, we follow the algorithm Bubble Sort and Merge Sort from the project guides.


## Use the makefile provided with the other files

## Use Instructions: Command Line Instructions

./sort_race <numbers separated by spaces>


## Results
The program will run each algorithm one step at a time and provide a printout if there was a comparison that made a switch.
When an algorithm has finished sorting the list of numbers, the first algorithm is decided the winner and its total moves are
recorded. The second algorithm to finish is declared the looser and its total moves are recorded. When all algorithms are done
running, the algorithms final lists are printed and the Winner/Looser are printed out with their final count.
